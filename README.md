## The Problem

Operating systems like Windows often group font variations (e.g., `Arial Narrow`, `Arial Bold`) under a single parent family (`Arial`). While logical, this hides variations within style menus, making it cumbersome for designers, developers, and typographers who want to see every font as a distinct, easily accessible family.

This utility solves that problem by intelligently batch-processing your fonts and rewriting their metadata to force them to appear as standalone families.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üöÄ **Batch Processing:** Load and process dozens of TrueType (`.ttf`) and OpenType (`.otf`) fonts in a single operation.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Intelligent Renaming:** Automatically modifies all necessary name table entries for maximum compatibility across different operating systems and applications.
*   üìä **Detailed Reporting:** Review a comprehensive before-and-after report of all proposed metadata changes before committing to save the files.
*   ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-time Feedback:** A live log panel, progress bar, and Estimated Time Remaining (ETR) calculator keep you informed during processing.
*   üíæ **Automatic Backups:** For peace of mind, the utility automatically creates a timestamped backup of every original font file before processing.
*   üé® **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive, and intuitive interface built with Tkinter's modern `ttk` themed widgets.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Get the application running on your local machine in two simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6 or newer
*   The `fonttools` Python library

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/font-renamer-utility.git
    cd font-renamer-utility
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The application relies on the `fonttools` library. Install it using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install fonttools
    ```

## üìñ Usage Guide

1.  **Launch the Application:**
    Run the `main.py` script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Load Fonts:**
    Click **`Load Font(s)`**. You can select multiple `.ttf` or `.otf` files. Backups of your original files will be created automatically in a `.font_backups` folder.

3.  **Process Fonts:**
    Click **`Process All Fonts`**. The application will analyze each font and generate new metadata. The UI will display real-time progress.

4.  **Review Changes (Recommended):**
    After processing, click **`View Batch Details`**. This opens a report comparing the original and proposed names for every font, allowing you to verify the changes.

5.  **Save Modified Fonts:**
    Click **`Save All Modified Fonts`** and choose an output directory. The new font files, with sanitized names, will be saved there.

6.  **Reset:**
    Click **`Reset`** to clear the application's state and start a new batch.

<summary><strong>üî¨ The Technical Details: Renaming Logic & Codebase</strong></summary>

### How the Renaming Works

The utility's core logic is designed to trick an OS into un-grouping a font variation by making it a new, standalone family.

1.  **Create a New Family Name:** It combines the original family and subfamily names. For example, a font with Family=`"Inter"` and Subfamily=`"SemiBold"` becomes the new Family=`"Inter SemiBold"`.
2.  **Standardize the New Subfamily:** It sets the font's *new* subfamily to `"Regular"`.
3.  **Update All Name IDs:** This new `"Family"` and `"Subfamily"` data is written to all relevant name IDs within the font's internal name table (`nameID` 1, 2, 4, 16, 17, 21, 22) to ensure maximum compatibility across platforms and software.

The OS now sees a new font family called `"Inter SemiBold"` that has only one style: `"Regular"`. This forces it to be listed as a top-level font family.

### Codebase Structure

The project is organized into several key modules:

-   `main.py`: The main application entry point, containing the `FontRenamerApp` class which manages the GUI, state, and threading.
-   `processing/font_processor.py`: Contains the `FontProcessor` class, which handles all the low-level font file interactions using the `fonttools` library.
-   `dialogs/font_dialogs.py`: Helper functions for creating native-looking file and directory dialogs.
-   `utils/logging_config.py`: Sets up the application's logging configuration to direct output to the GUI.
