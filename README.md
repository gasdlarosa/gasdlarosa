## 🚀 Showcase Projects

Here are a few of my recent projects. The source code for these applications is kept in private repositories.

### ✒️ AI Signature Editor

> An intuitive desktop application designed to process signature images using an AI-powered background removal model. This tool allows users to quickly extract a signature from its background, recolor it, resize it to specific dimensions, and save it as a transparent PNG, perfect for digital documents.
