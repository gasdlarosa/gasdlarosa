# Hi there, I'm Gaspar dela Rosa  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer passionate about creating useful and efficient applications. Here's one of my recent projects:

##AI Signature Editor

An intuitive desktop application designed to process signature images using an AI-powered background removal model. This tool allows users to quickly extract a signature from its background, recolor it, resize it to specific dimensions, and save it as a transparent PNG, perfect for digital documents.
