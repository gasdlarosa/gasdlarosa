<summary><strong>‚¨áÔ∏è 4K YT Downloader (with Authentication)</strong> - Download YouTube content with role-based authentication ‚¨áÔ∏è</summary>
<br>

A modern, cross-platform GUI application built with Python and CustomTkinter for downloading YouTube content. It utilizes `yt-dlp` for core downloading and `ffmpeg` for media processing, and features an integrated role-based authentication system.

This version is simplified for ease of use, focusing on producing universally compatible media files.

## Features

*   **Role-Based Authentication:** Secure login for Administrator and Operator roles using `bcrypt` and an embedded SQLite database.
*   **Intuitive & Simple GUI:** Built with CustomTkinter (CTK) for a modern aesthetic. The interface is streamlined for a simple workflow.
*   **One-Click Downloads:**
    *   **Video:** Downloads the highest available quality and automatically converts it into a universally compatible **MP4 (H.264/AAC)** file.
    *   **Audio:** Downloads the best audio available and converts it to **MP3**.
*   **Playlist Support:** Automatically detects playlists and downloads all items sequentially.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Real-time download and post-processing status.
*   **User Management (Admin Only):** Administrators can register and delete Operator accounts.
*   **Logging:** In-app log viewer for troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need Python and several packages, as well as the external utility `FFmpeg`.

1.  **Python 3.x:** Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **FFmpeg:** This is **critical** for converting and merging video/audio.
    *   Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
    *   **Installation:** You must ensure the `ffmpeg` executable is accessible from your system's PATH.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional) or Save Files:**
    Create a project folder and save all the provided `.py` files inside it. Create subfolders `processing` and `utils` and place the respective files inside them.

2.  **Install Required Python Packages:**
    Open a terminal or command prompt in your project folder and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Initial Administrator Setup:**
    *   On the first run, the database is created. The administrator account is created upon the first login attempt.
    *   Select the **Administrator** role.
    *   Enter the fixed PIN: **`116898`**
    *   The application will create the administrator account and log you in.

3.  **Administrator Actions:**
    *   Once logged in, the Administrator can access **File -> Account Registration** to create new **Operator** users.
    *   Use **File -> User Management** to view and delete existing Operator accounts.

4.  **Operator Login:**
    *   Select the **Operator** role.
    *   Enter the username and PIN created by the administrator.

5.  **Downloading Content:**
    *   Paste a YouTube URL into the entry field.
    *   Click **Fetch**.
    *   Once the video/playlist information appears, click either **Download Video (MP4)** or **Download Audio (MP3)**.

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Windows Component Registrar (DLL & OCX)</strong> - Smart batch script for registering COM components ‚öôÔ∏è</summary>
<br>

A robust and user-friendly batch script for automatically registering COM components (`.dll` and `.ocx` files) on Windows. It intelligently handles administrator privileges and 32/64-bit compatibility issues, making it a reliable tool for developers, IT professionals, and power users.

## Overview

Registering legacy DLL and OCX components on modern Windows systems can be a tedious and error-prone task. This script automates the entire process. It ensures that the correct registration tools are used, handles required permissions gracefully, and provides a clear summary of its actions.

## Key Features

-   **‚úÖ Automatic Administrator Elevation**: The script detects if it's running without administrative privileges and will automatically prompt for elevation via the User Account Control (UAC) dialog.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Smart 32/64-bit Compatibility**: On 64-bit versions of Windows, it automatically uses the 32-bit version of `regsvr32.exe` from the `SysWOW64` directory. This is crucial for ensuring compatibility with older 32-bit components.
-   **üîç Pre-registration Check**: To improve efficiency and prevent unnecessary operations, the script first checks the Windows Registry to see if a component is already registered.
-   **üìÇ Batch Processing**: Simply drop all your `.dll` and `.ocx` files into the `components` subfolder, and the script will process them all in one go.
-   **üìä Detailed Summary Report**: After execution, a final report is displayed, showing how many components were successfully registered, how many were already registered, and how many failed.
-   **üìú User-Friendly Instructions**: The script starts by displaying clear, concise instructions, ensuring the user understands the prerequisites and process before any action is taken.

## Prerequisites

-   Windows Vista or newer (due to the UAC elevation method).
-   The `.dll` and `.ocx` files you wish to register.

## How to Use

1.  **Download:** Clone this repository or download the `register_components.bat` file.

2.  **Create the Directory Structure:**
    -   Place the `register_components.bat` file in a folder of your choice.
    -   In that same folder, create a new subfolder and name it exactly `components`.

3.  **Add Components:**
    -   Copy all the `.dll` and `.ocx` files that you need to register into the newly created `components` folder.

    Your folder structure should look like this:

    ```
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyProject/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ register_components.bat
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component1.dll
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component2.ocx
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ another.dll
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ```

4.  **Run the Script:**
    -   Double-click the `register_components.bat` file.
    -   A command prompt window will appear with instructions. Press any key to continue.

5.  **Approve UAC Prompt:**
    -   A **User Account Control (UAC)** prompt will appear asking for administrator privileges. You **MUST** click "Yes" for the script to function correctly.
    -   The script will then proceed to register all the components and will display the final summary when finished.

## Understanding the Output

The script provides real-time feedback as it processes each file. The final summary is broken down into three categories:

-   **Successfully Registered**: The number of new components that were registered without errors.
-   **Already Registered**: The number of components that were skipped because they were already present in the Windows Registry.
-   **Failed to Register**: The number of components that could not be registered. This can happen if a file is not a valid COM component, is corrupt, or is missing its own dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

If a component fails to register, consider the following:

-   **Missing Dependencies**: The `.dll` or `.ocx` may depend on other libraries that are not present on the system. Use a tool like "Dependency Walker" to check for missing dependencies.
-   **Corrupt File**: The component file itself may be corrupted or incomplete. Try re-downloading or obtaining a fresh copy.
-   **Not a Registrable Component**: Not all `.dll` files are COM components and therefore cannot be registered with `regsvr32.exe`. The file must export the `DllRegisterServer` function.
